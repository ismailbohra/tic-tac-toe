## üöÄ How It Works  

### Game Modes  
1. **AI Mode**:  
   - The game board interacts with a backend-powered AI that uses the **Minimax Algorithm** to calculate the best move.  

2. **Quick Match**:  
   - Players are matched in real time using a temporary variable to manage matchmaking.  
   - Once two players are paired, they are assigned a room, and gameplay begins.  

3. **Room Mode**:  
   - A player creates a room and gets a unique link to share.  
   - Other players can join via the link to start the game.
